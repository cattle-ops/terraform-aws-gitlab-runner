### Terraform 0.12

Module is available as Terraform 0.12 module, pin to version 4.x. Please submit pull-requests to the `develop` branch.

Migration from 0.11 to 0.12 is tested for the `runner-default` example. To migrate the runner, execute the following steps.

- Update to Terraform 0.12
- Migrate your Terraform code via Terraform `terraform 0.12upgrade`.
- Update the module from 3.10.0 to 4.0.0, next run `terraform init`
- Run `terraform apply`. This should trigger only a re-creation of the the auto launch configuration and a minor change in the auto-scaling group.

### Terraform 0.11

Module is available as Terraform 0.11 module, pin module to version 3.x. Please submit pull-requests to the `terraform011` branch.

## 3.10.0 - 2019-07-29
