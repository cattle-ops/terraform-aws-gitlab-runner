# Example - Spot Runner - Private subnet

In this scenario the runner agent is running on a single EC2 node and runners are created by [docker machine](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/autoscale.html) using spot instances. Runners will scale automatically based on configuration. The module creates by default a S3 cache that is shared cross runners (spot instances).

This examples shows:

  - Usages of public / private subnets.
  - Usages of runner of peak time mode configuration.
  - Registration via GitLab token.
  - Auto scaling using `docker+machine` executor. âžœ tmp cat terraform-aws-gitlab-runner/examples/runner-docker/\_docs/README.md

# Example - Runner - Docker runner

In this scenario the docker executor is used to schedule the builds. Builds will run on the same EC2 instance as the agent. No auto scaling is supported.

## Prerequisite

The terraform version is managed using [tfenv](https://github.com/Zordrak/tfenv). If you are not using `tfenv` please check `.terraform-version` for the tested version.
