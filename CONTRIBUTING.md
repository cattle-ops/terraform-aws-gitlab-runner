## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Coding Style
We use the [Terraform Style conventions](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/style.html). They are enforced with ci scripts.

## Documentation
The README.md in the root is generated by a manual script in `ci/bin/autodocs.sh`. The script generate the variable tables, merge the in the README.md file based on the file in the `_docs` folder.

## Testing
No automated tests are available. The example directory takes care of a few scenario's.
