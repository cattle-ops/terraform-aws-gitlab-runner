# Contribution guide

We appreciate your thought to contribute to open source. :heart: We want to make contributing as easy as possible. You are welcome to:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Coding Style
We use the [Terraform Style conventions](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/style.html). They are enforced with CI scripts.

## Documentation
We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to update the Terraform inputs and outputs in the documentation via [terraform-docs](https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs). Ensure you have installed those components.

## Testing
No automated tests are available. The example directory takes care of a few scenario's.
